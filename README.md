# TripPlanner
### A Proprietary Framework Designed and Developed by Omnish Singhal

**TripPlanner** is a next-generation travel finance application designed to solve the chaos of group and family trip management. Unlike generic expense trackers, TripPlanner is built with a deep understanding of complex group dynamics—especially families with dependents.

## 🚀 Key Features to Pitch

### 1. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parent-Child Dependency (The "Killer" Feature)
**"Most apps treat everyone as independent adults. TripPlanner understands families."**
- **The Problem:** In apps like Splitwise, adding kids means creating fake accounts or awkwardly manually splitting bills every time.
- **The TripPlanner Solution:** You can link members (e.g., "Alice") as dependents of a parent (e.g., "Bob").
- **How it works:** When you add a "Dinner for 5" and split it equally, the app automatically calculates that Bob owes for himself AND Alice. The debt is consolidated to Bob. No math required.

### 2. 📄 Professional PDF Snapshots
**"Generate a financial report that looks like it came from an accountant."**
- **One-Click Export:** Instantly generate a PDF "Snapshot" of the entire trip.
- **Detailed:** Includes day-by-day breakdowns, category splits, and a final settlement plan.
- **Use Case:** Perfect for sharing with the group at the end of a trip for total transparency.

### 3. 🧠 Smart & Heuristic Settlement
**"It fixes your broken math."**
- **Global Split Detection:** Even if you messed up the member list halfway through, the app's heuristic engine detects "Equal Splits" and "Standard Unit" shares to auto-correct and recalculate expenses seamlessly.
- **Optimized Debts:** Reduces a web of 20 transactions down to just 3 or 4 simple payments between friends.

### 4. 🎨 Premium "Glassmorphism" Design
**"It just feels better to use."**
- **Aesthetics:** Built with a stunning, translucent glass-like interface, smooth animations, and a curated background that changes with the theme.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Fully supported "Smart Theme" that remembers your preference across devices (defaulting to a clean Light mode).

## 🗣️ The "Elevator Pitch" for your Friend

> "You know how messy it gets tracking money when we travel with families? I started using **TripPlanner**. It's different because it actually handles families—I can just add my kids as my 'dependents,' and it automatically handles the math for me. Plus, at the end, I can literally just hit one button and send everyone a professional PDF reporting exactly who owes what. It’s way cleaner than Splitwise and doesn't hide charts behind a paywall."
